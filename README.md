## Description
For this Week 14 Challenge we were tasked with creating an application where developers or tech fans can publish blog posts as well as comment on other posts as well. This application follows the Model View Controller paradigm in its structure and uses Handlebars.js as the templating language. The User Story was as follows:

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech 
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/tech-blog-app to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
In order to use this app you will first need to navigate to the `root` folder and open up a terminal. When the terminal is open, run the command `npm i` to install your dependencies. You also need to make sure you install the depencies for mySQL/Sequelize/dotenv/express/bcrypt as well. When those are finished installing, type `npm run seed` into your GitBash terminal which will seed our database. Once that is finished, you will type the command `npm run start` which will start the server and open up our localhost. There you will view the Tech Blog Application in all its glory!
